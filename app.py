### How it works
This app determines your guardian angel based on your birth date using Kabbalistic tradition. It calculates the sun's apparent ecliptic longitude at noon on your birth date and maps it to one of 72 angels (each governing 5 degrees of the zodiac circle, starting from the vernal equinox). This method provides accuracy for leap years and dates between 1900 and 2100, using astronomical formulas aligned with traditional references, including considerations for historical figures like Jesus (traditional birth December 25 corresponding to Poyel in approximate fixed ranges, but calculated precisely). The year is used to handle leap years correctly, and February 29 is valid only in leap years. Special birth dates (January 5, March 19, May 31, August 12, October 24) fill the calendar gaps for accuracy (360/72 angels cover 360 days, these 5 extra days link to archangels), allowing choice of any angel and a mission to guard humanity. For dates in specific periods, the corresponding archangel is the overseeing leader for that season, and the element's archangel is the leader for the angel's element and zodiac.
Updated seasonal analogy (custom, not standard TCM): Jan-Mar Earth/Spring Uriel, Mar-May Fire/Summer Michael, May-Aug Water/Wet Gabriel, Aug-Oct Aether/Autumn Nathaniel, Oct-Jan Air/Winter Raphael. The analogy is not standard in TCM (where Spring Wood, Summer Fire, Late Summer Earth, Autumn Metal, Winter Water), but updated as per user specification.
